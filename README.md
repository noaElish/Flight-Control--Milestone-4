### **Basic information**
* Purpose of this extercise-
we created a control system to monitor active flights, as well as adding new flights. the programm works in a way so that it shows only the active flights at the moment. the system reset every few second, in order to be as accurate as possible. 
in addition, our system is in sync with other systems as well. as tou can see, the system follows internal flights- the ones we inserted, as well as external flights from external flights.

If you wish to insert some flight- there are two main ways to do that:
* External Flights
you can log as a new system to our system, using the "PostMan" app, following these steps:
1.
* Internal Flights
  * you can insert new Json file with the flight detailes and insert it in the "upload new flight" button.
  * you can use the "PostMan" app-
